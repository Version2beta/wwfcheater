A small app for finding words amongst a jumble of letters.

This version of the project was started in a lunchtime #pairwithme session with @StephenBallNC, and finished after work that day. However, it was really just preparation for a pairing session with my 19 year old daughter who is also (like me) learning to program in Ruby.

The algorithm came out of discussion with her on solving this problem. She and I also coded it together, and that product will be on her GitHub account once she sets it up.
